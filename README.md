# Carbon_Treatment_-protect-
This project id focused on pre-treating activated carbon in 0.23% peracetic acid before adsorption study 
## Background
Point of use filters has been utilised in most home as a safe gurd to water quality. However these filter prone to microbial proliferation and chemical contamination
this study was focus on determinine desorption capacity of biological acitve carbon
